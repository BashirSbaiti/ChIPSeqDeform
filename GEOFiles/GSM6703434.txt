!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = To enable immune-precipitation, a C-terminal 3x FLAG tag was added to dCas9 and the gene cloned under the control of a ptet promoter on plasmid pLC133. Samples were prepared from E. coli MG1655 harboring pLC133 and psgRNAcos plasmids with 3 different guide RNAs, a control guide targeting lacZ, the AGGAA_non1 guide or the ACCCA_non1 guide. Cells were grown at 30 degree and induced with aTc when OD600 reaches 0.2. When OD600 reaches 1.0, formaldehyde (final concentration: 1%) was added to fix the cells. After that, glycine was added to block formaldehyde. Samples were further washed with PBS and pelleted.   Samples were then resuspended in 1 ml of IP lysis buffer (50 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 0.4 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.5% Triton-X100, 10% Glycerol), 20 μl 0.1 M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μl complete protease inhibitor (50x), 5 μl RNase inhibitor (40 U/ul). Cell lysis was performed using a covaris sonicator (S220), 10x (10 sec on, 10 sec off, Amplitude 15 μm) until the samples appeared clear. Samples were centrifuged and the supernatant mix with Anti-Flag M2 Affinity Gel (Sigma-Aldrich) beads and incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. After that, the beads were washed 5 times with IP lysis buffer, then eluted in Chip-Seq elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 1.0% SDS). Bead pellets were incubated at 65°C in a water bath for 1 hour, then spun at 14,000 rpm for 3 minutes. The supernatant, which contains the Chipped DNA was then collected.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Samples were column purified to remove RNA, then fragment ends were repaired and phosphorylated with T4 polymerase and T4 PNK. After that, an A was added to 3’ end of repaired ends, then the DNA fragments with 3’ A overhang was ligated with illumina TrueSeq Adaptors. Samples were PCR amplified using primers (LC1504_TruSeq_P5 5’- AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACAC-’3, LC1505_TruSeq_P7 5’- CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGAT-’3).
